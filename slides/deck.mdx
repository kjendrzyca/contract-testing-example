## Agenda

- What is Contract Testing?
- Trust issues
- Example 1
- Example 2
- Example 3
- Q&A

---

## What is Contract Testing?

- Scaling teams / External teams
- Large-scale manual system test (like microservices)
- Sticking to the interface

---

## Trust issues

- Communication / Knowledge (how we use the API)
- Lack of skill
- Accidental changes
- Timezones

---

## Example 1 - DB

- big static database
- no chance to run it locally
- different timezone
- no migrations
- a lot of work

- in the morning - the app doesn't work ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

---

### Good practices

- avoid big snapshots
- communicate a lot

---

## Example 2 - API

- similar as with the db example

---

## Example 3 - Pact

- Consumer-Driven Contract tests

### Good practices

- check only what's needed
- don't use when you control the whole thing

- Jest snapshot language support (VSCode)
- You can use JSON Schema or TypeScript instead of snapshots, but I haven't tested that myself, so not recommending any links (fell free to make a PR)
